*** To Fix

**** request handling

1. we do not need to check for =GET= and =POST= in request handlers that
   have only one method registered on them. eg: =api.org:588= at =show_users()=

2. We need to check for existence of keys in request handlers, and not
   simply dereference the dictionary. eg: =show_users()=
**** Add user API change
We cannot create an admin user with =add_user=.
Hence, remove the =role= parameter from the =add_user= API.
make =role = "user"= by default.

Remove =role= as a parameter from the REST API. Change =add_user=
in system interface to set =role = "user"= by default.
