* Application:  A web-based directory of users
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: requirements
:END: 
 The application is a simple directory of users and some related
 information (name and email).  The system has users.  There is a
 special user called =admin-user=.  Once a user is logged in, the
 system allows for the following /operations/

  1. Viewing the details of a user,
  2. Creating a user,
  3. Updating the details of that user,
  4. Deleting a user.  

All interaction is via a login session.  That is, users need
to log in before they can perform any operation.  Which
operation may be executed on what entity depends on both
that entity and the user who is logged in.  For example, if
user =u= is logged in, he/she may modify the details of user
=v= iff either =u = v= or =u = admin=.

The rest of the sections have more detailed requirements. 


* User
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_user
:END: 
  User is an entity in the system.  There are several user(s) in the system
  whose type is =User=.  The interaction of a user with the system is defined
  by the requirements below. 

  Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_user][User]]

** Composition
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_user_composition
:END: 
   The system has users.
   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#user_session_sets][user-set]]
** User Identification
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_user_identification
:END: 
   Each user has an email address (string that corresponds to a
   valid email addr).  

   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinality]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]] constraints on [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_email][Email]]
   entity.

** Uniqueness of a User
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_user_uniqueness
:END: 
   Email identifies a user.  Two users with the same email
   are the same users. 

   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinality]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]] constraints on [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_email][Email]]
   entity.

** Name Attribute
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_user_name
:END: 
   Each user has a Name (string).

      Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinality]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]] constraints on [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_name][Name]] entity.

** Role of a User
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_user_role
:END: 
   Each user has exactly one role, and by default when a user is created, the
   role that is associated with the newly created user is =user=

   entity.

* Role
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_role
:END: 
  Different privileges for accessing the system is maintained by roles.  A role
  whose type is =Role= defines a set of privileges i.e. what is accessible and
  what is not accessible in the system.

  Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_role][Role]]

** Role Mapping to a User
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_role_mapping_to_user
:END: 
   Each user is mapped to exactly one role in a given session, In any given
   session, a user is mapped to his/her role.

   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinalility]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]] constraints on [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_role][Role]] and
   [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_user][User]] entities.

** Types of Roles
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_role_types
:END: 
   There are 2 kinds of roles: =admin= and =user=.  Each role determines what
   data access privileges are available to the user.   


** Role Privileges
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_role_privileges
:END:    

   1. A user with role =admin= has the ability to:

      1. Create a new user, Read and Update information of all users, and
         Delete all other users.

   2. A user with role =user= has the ability to:

      1. View certain information of other users in the system.

      2. Update his/her information. 
      

** User with =admin= role
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_role_admin
:END:    
   There is atleast one user with role =admin= in the system.

   Realized in data model as an [[../data-model/index.org::#admin_user][admin user]]

* Session
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_session
:END: 
  A session defines the set of actions that a user is allowed to perform.
  Realized in datamodel as [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_session][Session]]

** Login is Mandatory
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_session_login
:END: 
   Users are required to login to the system.
   
   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#user_session_sets][session-set]]

** A logged user and a session
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_session_association
:END: 
   Each user once logged in is associated with a session.

   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinality]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]] constraints on
   [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_session][Session]] entity.

** Constraints
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_session_constraints
:END: 
   At any given time a user cannot have more than one session.  Realized in
   data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinality]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]] constraints on [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_session][Session]] entity.

** Privileges
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_session_privileges
:END: 
   Operations are permitted only if the user is logged into the system.

* Questions/scenarios
** Deleting oneself?  
- Question :: Can a user delete himself/herself?
- Ans :: No

** No user with admin role? 

- Question :: Is it possible for the system to have no user
     with role admin?

- Answer :: No.  There is at least one user in the system
     with role =admin=.  This is ensured by configuring the
     system with an initial user with role =admin=. 

** Multiple sessions for same user?   

- Question :: Is it possible for a user to be simultaneously
     logged in into the system in two different sessions?

- Answer :: No.
